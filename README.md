# PROGRESSIO
A place to track progress in any hobby or activity.

**Link to project:** http://progress.cyclic.app

<!-- ![alt tag](http://placecorgi.com/1200/650) -->

## Tools Used:
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, MongoDB, Mongoose, Passport, EJS, Express, Multer, Node.JS 

## How It's Made:

Users can create accounts and login. When logged in, they can edit their profile, create progress reels and create captures within those reels. The idea is that anyone would be able to see or track progress of anyone and their hobbies, if they wish to share. Signup requires unique usernames and emails, with a confirm password input. Users can also follow each other and view the followers they have.

## Organizing your progress with the Progress Reel

To start, first you would need to create a reel, which can be seen as a folder for your progress. To do so, navigate to your profile page, then click the "create reel" button on the left hand side (desktop) or at the top of the page (mobile). From there, a popup will appear and you can title your interest/hobby then write a short description for the reel.

## Edit User Profile

To edit your profile, simply navigate to your profile page and click the edit profile button. From there, you can change your displayed name (not username), change your profile description, add a external link and change your profile picture

## Info about your Captures

Within the reel view, you can like the reels, like specific captures within the reel, or check out specific captures. Within each captures, users can add comments to those captures and share what they want to share. Captures can either be an image upload, a plain text upload, or a link upload. All captures are formatted and viewable.

## Social and the Feed

Within the feed, you can see all captures made by people you currently follow. From there you can like, comment and soon be able to bookmark posts. Users can search for their own hobbies or interests to find captures and reels made by other people with those same hobbies or interests. If nothing found, why not start it?

## Privacy

Being able to find the progress of others to act as a reference for your own journey is one of the many goals I wanted to reach with this project, but I do understand some may not want their progress to be shared to the world. So to help overcome that, users can hide their profile and progress from public view, where only friends can see the progress. This option will soon be extended to individual progress reels.

No matter what option you pick, personal information on the site is encrypted.

## Optimizations:

- Search Functionality
- 'How-To-Use' Event
- Make app Section 508 compliant
- Implement Tailwind for reusuable styles
- Video clip upload
- Bookmarks
