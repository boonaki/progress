## Dependencies:
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, MongoDB, Mongoose, Passport, EJS, Express, Multer, Node.JS 

### A full-stack social media application


## How It's Made:

### Users can create accounts and login. When logged in, they can edit their profile, create progress reels and create captures within those reels. The idea is that anyone would be able to see or track progress of anyone and their hobbies, if they wish to share. Signup requires unique usernames and emails, with a confirm password input. Users can also follow each other and view the followers they have.

### To create a reel, navigate to your profile page, then click the "create reel" button on the left hand side (desktop) or at the top of the page (mobile). From there, a popup will appear and you can title your hobby then write a short description for the reel.

### To edit your profile, simply navigate to your profile page and click the edit profile button. From there, you can change your displayed name (not username), change your profile description, add a external link and change your profile picture

### Within the reel view, you can like the reels, like specific captures within the reel, or check out specific captures. Within each captures, users can add comments to those captures and share what they want to share. Captures can either be an image upload, a plain text upload, or a link upload. All captures are formatted and viewable.

### Within the feed, the user can see all captures made by anyone. From there users can like, comment and soon be able to bookmark posts
